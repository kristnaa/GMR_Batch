Today's topics
----------------

Working with DDL Commanads 
==========================

DDL -> Data definition language

->Always It deals with the Data base structure of data base objects -> Tables , views, indexes , Procedures, Functions,......

-> Commands/Statements used in DDL are
	
	Create 
	Alter
	Drop
	Truncate
	Rename
	flashback
======
Create 
======

-> By using this Create statement we can can create any type of data base object.

-> syntax :
	
	create table <name> (column1 type1, column2 type2, ......);

-> cmd>   
		create table Customers (
			id int primary key  , 
			name varchar(30), 
			gender char(10), 
			dept varchar(20)
			); 

primary key -> to maintain a unique key or value for that particular column 
	    -> It dont allow duplicate keys or values into that column.

Note -> Ctrl + Enter   -> these keys are used to run the command 


`````````````To create user / db in Oracle Sql :

> create user name identified by password 

> grant resource, connect to user

> connect username/password

```````````````To get all the tables information in Oracle sql

> select * from tab;

`````````````My sql -> from Microsoft Commands

>  show databases ;
> create database db_name;
> use db_name;
> show tables;   -> To get the all tables present in the current data base


======
Alter
======
-> Its DDL command used to work with the data base object structure.
-> By using this Alter statement we can Add, remove , modify the data base object structures.

  	-> Used to add the columns in the table structure
	-> To remove the columns we can use this Alter statement
	-> Used to Rename the Columns or tables in the data base	
	-> We can modify the types of the columns at any time when ever we want.

```How to add New columns in Existing table ?
---------------------------------------------
 -> By using this ALTER and ADD statemets we can add one or more number of columns in the existing table.

systax :   
		
->	Alter table <tableName> add Column type;

->	Alter table <tableName> add (Column1 type1, Column2 type2, ......);

Usecase:    (Alter - add) 
--------

1) adding only one column 

cmd>	alter table employee add state varchar(15);

2) adding more than one column (>1)

cmd>	alter table employee add (city varchar(15), pincode int4);


Notes:
------
-> Its Not possible to create new columns at the required position inside the table structure.
-> The Newly created Columns will always gets created at the End of the Existing columns.


```How to remove Existing columns in Existing table ?
-----------------------------------------------------

-> By Usinng Alter and drop commands we can remove the or delete the Columns permanently from the data base tables.

Syntax :

	Alter table <Table_name> drop Column_name;

	Alter table <Table_name> drop (Column_name1, Column_name2);

UseCase :	(Alter - drop ) 

	alter table employee drop state;

	Alter table employee drop (state, pincode);

```How to Rename the Columns in the existing table structure
-------------------------------------------------------------

-> By Using Alter with rename we can change or modify the Names of the columns and name of the table in the existing table.

Syntax :

-> to change columns names

	Alter table <Table_name> rename column Old_Column_name to New_Column_name;

-> to change table name
	
	Alter table <Table_name> rename to <New_table_name>
	
Usecase :  (Alter - rename - to)
--------

cmd1>	alter table employee rename column city to state;
	
cmd2>   alter table employee rename column pincode to address;

cmd3> 	alter table employee rename to emp;


````How to change or Modify the columns data types
--------------------------------------------------
-> By using Alter & Modify we can change or modify the data types of the Columns or Fields or attributes in the data base tables

Syntax:

	Alter table <Table_name> Modify Column1 New_type1;
		
	Alter table <Table_name> Modify (Column1 New_type1, Column2 NewType2,..);

UseCase:	(Alter - modify )

	alter table employee modify state varchar(35);
		
	alter table employee modify (state varchar(15),dept varchar(30));

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes :

Orale and MySql differenaces of executing the statements:

-> The All queries above mention which is going to work for Oracle SQL
   only few cases some scenarions are not able to run inthe MySQl

-> Alter with drop and modify -> for Multipl columns always work in oracle DB.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========
Truncate
========
	
-> By Using this DDL Truncate commad/ statement we can remove or delete all rows of data Permanently from an existing table at a time.

-> As of now All DDL commands -> Create , Drop , Alter , Rename always focus on the 
   Data base object or table Structure only .

-> This Truncate focus on the entire data / all roecords of the table.

Sysntax:
-------

	Truncate table <Table_name>

Command>: 
-------
	
	select * from student;

Result : The complete rows or data is deleted permanently.

Note : It delete only data not the Table or Table structure.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=====
drop
=====

-> By using this DDL Commad -> Drop -> we can delete the entire Table structure.
-> Even though if the data present or not.

Syntax:
-------

	Drop table <table_name>

Command>
--------

	drop table student;

result:  Entire table structe along data will  get delete

-> If you try to retrive the data from the student table, you will get the following error.

Error ->  select * from student
 LIMIT 0, 1000	Error Code: 1146. Table 'gmrit.student' doesn't exist	0.000 sec.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

============
recyclebin ?
============

-> Its the location where all deleted Tables by the Drop statements or command.

-> We can retrieve the table which are deleted paremanently from the database.

-> To Retrive all the tables from the recyclebin use the following command.

Command>

	Select * from recyclebin;


Note : This will not work for MySql data base. Only work for oracle db.

-> To Re-Store the tables which are present in the recyclebin use the following command.

=========
flashback
=========
-> By using this command or statement we can re store the required tables.


Syntax:
 	
	flashback table <Table_name> to before drop;

Command:

	flashback table student to before drop;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important points 
------------------

DDL -> All DDL commands bydefault they  will perform -> Auto Commit
	
	Create 
	Alter
	Drop
	Truncate
	Rename
	
DML -> insert , delete , update commands by default these will not perform -> Auto commit

Note : 

-> That is the reason we cannot perform rollback function on the operations performed by DDL commands.
-> But we can rollback the changes of data which perfomed by the DML commands.


Q) What is the difference between Drop , Delete  &  Truncate

 1) Truncate  [DDL]
  ------------------

  -> It deletes all the rows  ** Pemanently    >> Not delete the Table
	
  -> No Manual Commit is required

 2) Delete  [DML]
 -----------------

  -> It deletes all the rows or only selected rows , Not Permanantly.	  >> Not delete the Table
   
   -> Additionally need to use Commit;


  3) Drop  [DDL] 
  ---------------

   -> It delete Comlete TABLE Structure .  Permanently.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
==========================
Working with DML Commanads 
==========================

-> Data Manipulation languages 
-> it delas with Actual data of the tables or data base objects -> Commnads -> insert , delete and update.

Note : refer previous class notes for ur refera

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===============================
Working with DRL/DQL Commanads 
===============================

-> Data retrieval Language commands or Data Query Language Commands.
-> It Deals with the retrievel of the data from the data base.
-> Commands -> select

Systax:

>	select * from <Table_name>
>	select * from <Table_name> where <Conditions> 

Commnads 

> select * from employee;  
> select * from employee where id = 4;

-> Selection 
=============

-> It means to Retrive the data from the data base tables Completely or Partially based on the given condition .

-> We can use * for selecting Complete data

-> we can use WHERE condition for retriving only Partial data.

Systax 1:

	-> select * from <Table_name>;

	Command:

	 -> select * from employee; 

Systex 2:
	
	-> Select * from <Table_name> where <Condition> 

	Command: 

	Select * from employee where id  = 5;
	
``````````  here symbol * [star] represents all the Columns from the data base table

-> Projection 
==============
	
->It Used to Retrive the Some Particular data Only from the data base tables.

-> In this we cant use * Symbol and we need to use only Particular Column names from the tables
	
Systax 1:

	-> select columnName1 from <Table_name>;

	Command:

	 -> select name from employee; 
	

Systax 2:

	-> select columnName1 , columnName2 ,...  from <Table_name>;

	Command:

	-> select name, gender from employee; 

	 -> select name, gender , dept  from employee; 

Output
======

name   gender   dept
----	-----	-----
rakeh	male	java
mukesh	male	python
manasa	female	python
shekar	male	dotnet

Note:
-----
In Projections we are not going to use the  * Symbols;


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==========================
Working with DCL Commands
==========================

DCL -> Data Controll language commads

-> It is used by DBA account to Give/Grant and revoking the permission from the User/ Data base.

-> Commnads -> 
	
	Grant , 
	Revoke

```` Create a table using DBA account

	command -> Create user <User_name> identified by <Password>

	
	Username : javaDeveloper_one
	password : oracle1234
	
  1) Grant :
  ----------

-> Grant command/ statement used to give all permissions to the created user/ data base.

Syntax:

	Grant resource , Connecto to <user_name>;
	
Command:

	Grant resource , connect to javaDeveloper_one;

 
  2) Revoke : 
  ----------- 
 
-> This Revoke command/ statement used to TakeOut all the permissions from the user/ data base.

Sysntax:
	
	Revoke resource , from <User_name>;

Commmand:

	Revoke resource , from javaDeveloper_one;

==========================
Workign with TCL commnads
==========================

-> Transaction controll language commands

-> It deals with the Transactions made by the programmer to the database.

-> Commands are -> 
	
	commit;
	rollback;
	savepoint;

-> Transaction
===============

-> When a User performs any operation with the help of DML commands [ insert , delete , update ] to the data base objects we can call it a Transaction.

-> Session / Transactions 
==========================

-> Session means its an amout time given to the user to perform some activities or Transactions.

-> The User form Log in to the Log out , what ever the operations performed by him , we call it as 
   Transactions.


1) Commit 
===========
-> By using this command/ statement we can save the data permanenlty into the data base after performing any transaction.

-> It is Mandatory to save the data by running this command manually when we are dealing with 
   DML commnads . because of  DML commands dont perform Auto Commit.

 Command:
	    Commit;


2) rollback
=============

-> By Using this Roll back command we can getback all the changes or transaction made by the user to the bata base objects Before Commit.

-> If you once commit any transaction its not possible to revert back those changes again with the help of rollback command.

Command : 

	rollback;

3) savepoint
=============

-> It is used to Save some Transactions under a name.

Systanx :

	Savepoint <savepoint_name>;

Command: 
	
	savepoint insertsavepoint;

Example : 
---------

-> User 	
	
	created >>> Table 

	
	inserted(2) -> savepoint insertSavePoint  -->>>  insert(2) transactions stored in insertSavePoint 
	
	updated (2) -> savepoint updateSavepoint  -->>> update(2) transactions stored in updateSavepoint  

-> User

	-> I want to do commmit ->  insert(2) , updated(2) transactions will stored into database.


  	-> I want to do rollback ->    insert(2) , updated(2) transactions will  discarded from the database.

	
	-> Now Rollback only with one Savepoint

	Commad>  rollback to insertSavePoint  >> only insert(2) transactions discarded from the data base.
			
	Command> rollback to updateSavepoint  >> only update(2) transactions discarded from the data base.


-> Commmit; 		-> No data is there so nothing is going to be saved into the data base.
