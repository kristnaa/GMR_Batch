
			  DATA BASE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data, DataBase, DBMS

Data :
-----

-> Its a small piece of information/ raw information /any unprocessed data.

-> name - Kiran , age - 30 , city - Mumbai


All small data combined to form as some useful Information

-> Kiran is a employee & he is 30yrs old , living in Mumbai.


Data Base
---------

-> A Place where we can store the group of data in Organized way
-> Group of data storing some where is called Database

Ex:

Our Mobile -> small data base -> Contacts list

-> stores -> Names  ,Numbers, Email address and etc...


DBMS 
----

-> DBMS stands for Data Base Management System

-> It is used to Manage the data which is present inside the data base.

-> Its a Software to manage the data , we can easily perform adding , removing , modifying,   searching data.


Ex : BookS Library -> it contains lot of  books and managed by the person 


Softwares for Data bases
--------------------------

-> Oracle data base  -  oracle corpo
-> My Sql data base  - oracle corp
-> MongoDb   		- Mongodb
-> SQl server data base	- Microsoft corp
-> DB2 Data base -> IBM corph


Types of Data bases Management Systems
-------------------------------------

There are 2 types available 

1) RDBMS
2) NRDBMS


1) RDBMS / SQL data base
--------------------------

-> Relational - DBMS
-> 
	
  -> If a person wants to communicate with another person they need a language 
		-> English , Hindi, telugu ....

  -> If a User wants to communicate with Data base management system / software
     they need a language

		->  Language -> SQL -> [ Structured Query Language].

-> So we can call RDBMS as a SQL data base.

-> By Using this language SQL we can communicate or work with any type of software       which comes under "RDBMS".

-> In RDBMS all data managed in Relational forms so we are calling this as Relational data base management system

-> All the data is stored or represented in the form Structure format or 2 dimentional format [rows & columns] 
  
   Structured -> Consists of ->  Tables , Columns , rows

	
			Tables -> Relations

			Columns -> Fields  / Attributes
		
			Rows -> Tuples / Records

->   customers  - > table

 customer_id		customer_name		customer_city
--------------		---------------		---------------
	1		Hari			Hyderabad         -> Tuples / rec
	2		Paul			Mumbai		  -> Tuples 	
	3		Praveen			Annavaram


Fields/ Attributes -> customer_id  , customer_name ,customer_city

Examples -> Oracle , Sql server , MySQL...


2) NRDBMS / No-Sql database
----------------------------

-> Non - RDBMS

-> Non Relationsl means -> No tables

-> It don't use any SQl language to store and maintain the data

-> So we can call this as No - SQl Data base.

-> It wont follow any Structure format [ Tables ] , and stores and maintains the data in several forms

Ex :  -> It stores the data in the form of JSON format [Java script object notation]
		->  ex for MongoDb

      -> {
	
	"name"  : "Hari",
	"city"  : "Hyderabad",
	"occupation" : "software engineer"
		
	}

	-> Cascandra -> key and value pairs
	-> neo4j , GrpahQL -> Graphs data base
	-> Hbase -> columns data base
	 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SQL 
===
-> Structured Query Language

-> It is used to communicate with any type of RDBMS software.

-> In this we can write some statements and able to run inside the database those statements called as "SQL Statements or Queries".

-> The Queries can be anyform means it can be uppercase , lowercase because SQL is 
  a case insensitive programming language.

-> Its required to maintain semicolon  [ ; ] at the end of every statement

-> At a time its possible to run only one query / statement

-> If we want to run multiple statements or group of queries to perform any task base on the requirmenet than we can go for  PLSQL
 	
	PLSQL -> Procedural Language SQL

-> All the data will be stored or represented in the form of STRUCTED Format [Table] .



->   customers  - > table

 customer_id		customer_name		customer_city
--------------		---------------		---------------
	1		Hari			Hyderabad         -> Tuples / rec
	2		Paul			Mumbai		  -> Tuples 	
	3		Praveen			Annavaram


Query 1:
--------

select * from customers;   		//we can get all data at a time

output
------

customer_id		customer_name		customer_city
--------------		---------------		---------------
	1		Hari			Hyderabad         
	2		Paul			Mumbai		 	
	3		Praveen			Annavaram


Query 2:
--------

select * from customers where customer_name='paul';


output : 
-------

customer_id		customer_name		customer_city
--------------		---------------		---------------
	2		Paul			Mumbai	


Query 3
--------

select customer_city from cusomers where cusotmer_id = 3;     // SQL Query

Output:
-------

customer_id		customer_name		customer_city
--------------		---------------		---------------
	3		Praveen			Annavaram


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	
Oracle data base
----------------

-> It is one of the software comes under RDBMS softwares.

-> It use Structured format of data means tables format

-> SQL is used to work with Oracle to manage and storing and for retrieval operations in this data base.

-> There are 2 things are available

 	1) SQL 

	2) PLSQL  

-> PLSQL -> Procedural language SQL, used to run or execute the group of statements or queries.
-> when we want to execute some logics in data base we can use Stored Procedures or Stored functions.

-> The latest version of oracle is 23ai.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Set up environment for the oracle data base
-------------------------------------------

-> Access the link and download the zip file "OracleXE112.zip" , so this version is light weight.
	
 https://www.mediafire.com/file/ungqk8ggwof4h1h/OracleXE112_Win64.zip/file

-> AfterDownloading > Extract the zip file into any directory > 

	right click > Extract All > select Location directory > click Next 
	
-> In the specified installed location directory we can see One folder > DISK1

-> check for the file name -> "setup.exe" [Executable file].

-> Run or double click the file -> setup.exe file 

-> and give all permissions

-> Next > Next > .......  now it ask you enter or Give the PASSWORD

-> [Remember the password that you give]

->Store Current installation Settings:

Destination Folder: C:\oraclexe\
Oracle Home: C:\oraclexe\app\oracle\product\11.2.0\server\
Oracle Base:C:\oraclexe\
Port for 'Oracle Database Listener': 1521
Port for 'Oracle Services for Microsoft Transaction Server': 2030
Port for 'Oracle HTTP Listener': 8080

-> Now Click "Install" -> Button.  > After Installing > Click ->  Finish.

Work with Oracle db;
--------------------
3 Approaches
-------------
1) SQL* plus CLI [Command line interface] 
2) Web page - Get Started
3) GUI -Graphical user interface


1) Approach 1 -> Run SQL Command Line  [] 
-------------------------------------

-> Windows -> Search for -> "SQL" -> you can find the file > "Run SQL Command Line"

-> After opening cmd prompt of Run Sql command -> 

-> Give the command as -> connect

-> give the user name as -> system

-> give the password -> Its not visible to us while typing > click Enter

-> we will get a statement of -> Connected


cmd> 	SQL> connect
	Enter user-name: system
	Enter password:  			// we cant see password
	Connected.

-> To see the current user of the db

  > give command as -> show user
	
cmd> 	SQL> show user
	USER is "SYSTEM"

-> Oracle db contains some inbuilt tables to see all the tables present use the below command

cmd>  select * from all_users;

-> To Erase or to Clear entire screen , use the following command 

cmd>   cl scr      -> To clear the screen

-> To close the connection or to close the data base connection use the below command

cmd> exit



2) Approach 2 -> Using Web Page
--------------------------------

-> At the time of installation by default a file with the name of "Get Started" will create on the desktop.

-> Run or open that file -> It enrouted to Oracle web page

-> There you can find multiple options 
	
	Home, Storage , sessions, Parameters, Application Express

-> In This to create or to use any existing data bases we can use Application Express option 

-> After click on that option it ask us to provide username and password

-> After Log in ->>> again it will ask you to create WORK SPACE or Use Existing Work space

->  User name -> $$$$$$$$$
->  Express user name -> $$$$$$$
-> password -> *************
-> confirm password -> ***********

-> It creates a new work space with the above given credentials

-> Successfully created workspace "name". To begin, click here to login.

-> Now log in into WorkSpace dashboard with newly created username and password.

-> Go to SQL WorkShop option >>> and there we can see options like 

	1) Object Browser
	2) SQL Commands

-> 1) Object Browser

 -> It Contains all the inBuilt tables information in the data base
 -> In the dropdown -> Tables -> able to find all the tables information
 -> Ex : 

	EMP table
	DEPT table
	DEMO CUSTOMERS table
	DEMO USERS table

-> APex$ -> related tables contains only structure they dont contain any dummy data
-> apart from these tables remaining tables contains with some dummy data.

-> 2) SQL Commands
  
  -> This is the place where exactly we write SQL queries / statements 
     and able to run .

select * FROM EMP;
select * from dept;


Note :

-> by using web page approach if user already having the work space credentials 
-> Right of side home page of oracle you can find the Getting started option 
-> there you can enter your existing credentials to open existing work space.


3) Approach 3 
--------------
-> We can communicate the data base with the help of GUI [Graphical user interface].

->  To work with GUI we should download a tool called "Oracle sql developer"

step1:
-----
->  go to the following site and download the required Oracle sql developer zip 
   file based on your system configuration.

https://www.oracle.com/in/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/download/

step2:
-----
-> Extract the zip file in any directory location.

-> After extract go to the file >> sqldeveloper >> sqldeveloper.exe

-> Now run this executable file & right click pin to task bar.

Creating Connections
---------------------

-> After opening user can see a ui page contains Connections and reports at the left side of that page

-> Create a New Connection
---------------------------
-> Click on + [Plus icon] -> give Name of a connection > give User name & password > keep hostname & port numb & SID as same.

-> To check wether the user is present by doing validation with the TEST button

  -> If the user details are correct ->   Status --- Success
  -> If the user details are incorrect -> 

	Status -> Status : Failure -Test failed: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
https://docs.oracle.com/error-help/db/ora-01017/

-> To create Work sheet -> work sheet is for writing our SQL queries
   
	Right click on Connection > Open SQL work sheet

-> Toggle Line numbers -> To show the numbers for each and every query or line

-> To Close the connection -> 

	Right click -> DisConnect
-> for there few options for Re-connect options to refresh and re-connect data base


1st Connection
--------------

-> Connection name : DBA-Connection

	username : system
	
	password : oracle

	port num/ local host -> same only
	
	test > create connection.
	
2nd Connection   [Existing connection -> already created by using web page]
----------------

-> Connection name -> users-connection
	
	username : username // your username
	
	password : oracle // your own password

	remaining all are same
	
	test -> create connection.

Note 
=====

-> we can connect multiple schemas or the connection at a time.
-> when user wants to retrieve the data by using existing table as a Query value 
   we should maintain case original sensitive format

	select * from emp where job='MANAGER';   // it will work 

	select * from emp where job='manager';   // it won't work 
	
	* because -> in table MANAGER is in Uppercase letters

-> Always use single quotes [ ' ' ]to compare the values 
   if we use  [ " " ] , the query wont run and give error.

-> for the numbers its not required to enclose the value inside single quotes

	select ENAME, JOB from EMP where empno = 7521;	  // work

-> Its an optional to use Single quotes for the number values
	 
	select ENAME, JOB from EMP where empno = '7521';   // work
